# Liver Cancer Detection using CNN and Random Forest (MATLAB)

This project implements two machine learning models—Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random Forest—for classifying liver medical images into cancerous and non-cancerous categories.

Key features:  
Training and validation of CNN and Random Forest classifiers    
Confusion matrices and performance comparison between models  
Orientation and diagnosis planning workflow included  
Presentation slides used for project defense  

Note: Due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), the original medical images and datasets (train, validation, test folders) are not included in this repository. Only the processed code, evaluation results, and presentation materials are shared.  

The project aims to provide a reliable AI-based tool to assist in liver cancer diagnosis, focusing on model accuracy and interpretability.
